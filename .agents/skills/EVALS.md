# Authoring Skill Evaluations

This guide tells you how to write `evals/evals.json` for a NemoClaw skill. Every skill under `.agents/skills/` needs one. Scenarios measure whether the skill makes an agent **meaningfully better** at real user tasks — not whether the agent can recite the skill's keywords.

If you're new to the MVP design, start with `.context/skills-eval-mvp-plan.md` for context; this doc is the *how*.

## TL;DR

- **Three scenarios minimum** per skill. More is fine; fewer is not.
- **Prompts are user scenarios**: use-case specific, implementation-vague. Write them the way a real user would phrase them in Slack or a GitHub issue.
- **Assertions are behavioral claims** a grader can check with a quote or a yes/no. Avoid "response is helpful" — that's a vibe, not an assertion.
- **Scoring is with-skill vs without-skill delta.** A skill is valuable when loading it moves the score meaningfully upward on scenarios that target it.
- **Never ship `TODO:` stubs.** CI blocks them.

## File layout

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md
  evals/
    evals.json          # this file (required)
    files/              # per-scenario fixtures (optional)
      mock-config.yaml
      user-state.md
      ...
  references/
    ...
```

## Schema

Conform exactly to the [agentskills.io evaluation spec](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills). No bespoke fields.

```json
{
  "skill_name": "nemoclaw-user-get-started",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "I'm brand new to NemoClaw, on macOS. Walk me through getting my first sandbox running.",
      "expected_output": "Step-by-step: prerequisites, install, onboarding wizard, first prompt.",
      "files": [],
      "assertions": [
        "Response mentions checking the Node.js version prerequisite",
        "Response references the onboarding wizard or `nemoclaw onboard`",
        "Response explains that the first sandbox launches inside OpenShell",
        "Response does NOT assume Windows-specific steps"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Field contracts:

| Field | Required | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| `skill_name` | yes | Must match the skill directory name exactly |
| `evals[].id` | yes | Stable integer; never re-used or renumbered (CI baselines reference it) |
| `evals[].prompt` | yes | User-voice, implementation-vague (see rubric below) |
| `evals[].expected_output` | yes | One sentence describing the shape of a good response; grader does NOT match this literally |
| `evals[].files` | yes | Array; empty if no fixtures. Paths relative to the `evals/` directory |
| `evals[].assertions` | yes | 4–6 behavioral claims; each must be independently checkable |

## The implementation-vagueness test

Before committing a scenario, apply this test: **if you remove the skill name from the prompt, can you still tell which skill the prompt targets?**

- **Yes** → the prompt is too specific. It's testing a command, not the skill.
- **No** → good. The agent has to pick the right skill and use it well.

### Bad → Good examples

| Bad (implementation-specific) | Good (user-intent) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| "Run `nemoclaw onboard` and explain each flag" | "I just cloned NemoClaw and I'm not sure what to do next. Help me get set up." |
| "Use the configure-security skill to evaluate my sandbox egress controls" | "I'm preparing to deploy a NemoClaw sandbox in a team environment. What security trade-offs should I think about?" |
| "Invoke the cut-release-tag workflow for v0.0.22" | "We're ready to ship the next release. What's the process?" |
| "Read .agents/skills/nemoclaw-user-deploy-remote/SKILL.md and summarize" | "I want to run NemoClaw on a Brev GPU instance. Is that still supported?" |
| "Check the triage instructions for a bug labeled priority-high" | "There's a new bug report and I'm not sure how to label it." |

## Writing good assertions

An assertion is a **claim about the response** that a judge (LLM or human) can grade 1/0. It should be:

- **Specific** — quote-checkable or yes/no.
- **Behavioral** — about what the response does, not what it says about itself.
- **Independent** — doesn't depend on another assertion's outcome to evaluate.
- **Implementation-relevant** — captures something the skill is supposed to cause.

### Bad → Good assertions

| Bad | Why it's bad | Good |
|-----|--------------|------|
| "Response is accurate" | Not gradable | "Response names Node.js 22.16+ as the required version" |
| "Response is helpful" | Vibes | "Response lists at least three concrete next steps" |
| "Response covers everything important" | What's important? | "Response mentions both the CLI install and the onboarding wizard" |
| "Response is formatted nicely" | Format ≠ value | "Response uses numbered steps when describing a sequence" |
| "Agent uses the skill" | You can't observe that directly; only behavior | "Response mirrors the skill's recommended ordering: prerequisites → install → onboard → first prompt" |

### Negative assertions are fine (and useful)

| Example |
|---------|
| "Response does NOT recommend running `npm install -g` as root" |
| "Response does NOT assume the user is on Windows" |
| "Response does NOT mention the deprecated Brev compatibility path unless the user asks about it" |

Negative assertions catch skills that leak irrelevant or unsafe advice.

## Picking scenarios per skill

Three is the floor. Aim for scenarios that span:

1. **Happy-path primary use** — what most users will ask.
2. **Edge case or partial state** — user has some config, something went wrong, etc.
3. **Adjacent-wrong** — a prompt that *sounds* like this skill but shouldn't trigger it. Tests that the skill doesn't over-fire.

### Example breakdown for `nemoclaw-user-get-started`

| # | Type | Prompt shape |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | Happy path | "I'm new to NemoClaw on macOS. Get me running." |
| 2 | Partial state | "I ran `npm install` and now I'm not sure what to do." |
| 3 | Adjacent-wrong | "I want to customize which model a running NemoClaw sandbox uses." *(this is configure-inference territory, not get-started)* |

For adjacent-wrong scenarios, assertions should state what the response should **not** do ("Response does NOT walk the user through first-time installation steps") and optionally what it should do ("Response redirects to inference configuration").

## Fixtures (`files/`)

Most NemoClaw skills are docs- and journey-oriented. Fixtures are usually short **user-state descriptions** or **mock configs**, not large code files.

Use fixtures when the scenario needs the user to have a specific starting state.

### Example fixtures

`evals/files/user-state-partial-install.md`:

```markdown
# User state

- OS: macOS 14.3
- Node.js: 22.16 installed
- NemoClaw: cloned from GitHub, `npm install` completed
- NOT yet run: onboarding wizard, first sandbox launch
- Errors seen: none
```

`evals/files/mock-policy-blocking.yaml`:

```yaml
# What the user has in their policy file at the moment of the scenario
egress:
  allow: []
  deny: ["*"]
```

Reference fixtures in `files[]` with paths relative to `evals/`. The agent loads them as-is.

## What NOT to put in scenarios

- **Internal tool invocations.** If your prompt says "call the X CLI with flag Y", you're testing the CLI, not the skill.
- **Expected-output copy-paste.** `expected_output` is a shape hint for reviewers, not a string the grader matches.
- **Secrets, keys, or real customer data.** Fixtures are public — treat them that way.
- **Skill-name giveaways.** If your prompt names the skill explicitly, you're short-circuiting routing.
- **Multi-skill scenarios.** One scenario targets one skill. If you need a cross-skill test, that belongs in a separate chain-eval layer (not part of the MVP).

## Review checklist (before opening a PR)

- [ ] `evals.json` parses with `jq .`
- [ ] `skill_name` matches the directory name
- [ ] At least 3 scenarios
- [ ] Every scenario has ≥4 assertions
- [ ] Implementation-vagueness test passes for every prompt
- [ ] No `TODO:` markers remain
- [ ] At least one adjacent-wrong or negative-assertion scenario
- [ ] Fixtures in `files/` are self-contained (no repo-internal path assumptions)

## Lifecycle

1. **Scaffold** — `scripts/docs-to-skills.py` writes a stub when a skill is first generated. Stubs are `TODO:` placeholders.
2. **Author** — skill owner replaces stubs with real scenarios using this guide.
3. **Local run** — `npm run eval:skills -- --skills <name>` grades scenarios with and without the skill loaded.
4. **CI gate** — `.github/workflows/skills-eval.yml` blocks merges when a skill's delta regresses below baseline tolerance.
5. **Nightly baseline** — main branch is re-graded; `ci/skills-eval-baseline.json` updates.

See `ci/skills-eval-policy.md` for the exact delta tolerances, agent/judge model choices, and cost caps.
