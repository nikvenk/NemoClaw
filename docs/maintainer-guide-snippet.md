# NemoClaw — Community Engagement Quick Reference

> - **Always explain why** when closing — never close silently.
> - **Acknowledge contributors** when their work informs a merged solution, even if their PR didn't land.
> - **Security reporters get credit** — even when the fix goes through PSIRT, not GitHub.
> - **Be specific when declining** — vague feedback wastes everyone's time and damages trust.
> - **Route, don't reject** feature requests — backlog or Discussions, never silence.
> - **Name what you need** when asking for info — and give the contributor 7 days to respond.

### Closing Won't Fix / Out of Scope

| Reason | Label |
|---|---|
| Valid issue, won't address | `status: won't-fix` |
| Outside project design/scope | `status: out-of-scope` |
| Good idea, needs a proposal first | `status: needs-design` |

> Thanks for raising this. After review, we're closing as **[label]** because [one sentence]. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for scope guidance. We appreciate you taking the time.

---

### When Your Merge Supersedes Another PR

Comment on the closed PR before you merge:

> Closing in favor of #[N], which was merged and covers the same ground. Your [approach / test cases / edge case] helped shape the solution that landed — thanks for working on this.

**Security PRs:** Always acknowledge the finding explicitly, even when the fix went through PSIRT:

> Thanks for identifying this. The fix followed our [coordinated disclosure process](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/blob/main/SECURITY.md), but your report is a real contribution and we want to recognize it.

---

### Rejecting a Poorly Designed PR

1. **Acknowledge intent** — one sentence on what they were solving
2. **Name the specific problem** — don't say "not quite right," say why
3. **Give a path forward** — what would need to change, or ask them to start in an issue first

> Thanks for tackling [X] — it's a real gap. The approach here [specific problem]. Before we could accept this, we'd need [specific ask]. Happy to discuss the right approach in the issue first.

---

### Closing Duplicates

> Thanks for the report. This is a duplicate of #[N] — all discussion is happening there. Closing in favor of the original thread. Feel free to add context or subscribe to #[N] to follow along.

**Label:** `status: duplicate`

---

### Feature Requests

> Thanks for the suggestion. We've noted this and will review it — we'll update this issue if it moves forward. We don't have a timeline to share yet.

**Project status:** `No Status` (do NOT say "added to backlog" — that implies approval)

**Labels:** Always apply `enhancement` + the most specific sub-label (`enhancement: inference`, `enhancement: ui`, etc.) + any Tier 3 dimension labels (`Integration: Slack`, `Platform: MacOS`, `Provider: NVIDIA`, etc.)

*Full label reference: [docs/project-workflow.md](project-workflow.md)*

### Redirecting to Discussions

> This looks like a great topic for an open conversation rather than a bug or feature request. I've moved this to Discussions here: [link]. Closing the issue to keep the tracker focused on actionable items.

---

### Triage Acknowledgment

> Thanks for the detailed report — we've confirmed this and added it to our backlog. We don't have a timeline to share yet, but we've got it on our radar. We'll update this issue when work begins.

---

### Needs Info

**First contact** — label `status: needs-info`, leave open:

> Thanks for the report. To move forward, we need: [specific ask]. We'll keep this open for 7 days — if we don't hear back, we'll close it to keep the tracker tidy.

**7+ days, no response** — close + comment:

> Closing due to no response. If this is still happening, please open a new issue and include [repeat the specific ask]. Happy to take another look.

---

### Response Time Commitments

| Situation | Target |
|---|---|
| New issue | First response ≤ 5 business days |
| Open PR, no review | First comment ≤ 7 business days |
| Contributor asks for update | Reply ≤ 3 business days |

If you'll miss a window — post an update before it lapses.
